    <summary>The Vector Graphics Language</summary>
    <description>Asymptote is a powerful, descriptive, vector-graphics language with a natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing, inspired by [MetaPost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaPost) but with an improved C++-like syntax. Asymptote provides the same high-quality typesetting for figures that LaTeX does for scientific and mathematics text.
    
A major advantage of Asymptote over other graphics packages is that it is a programming language, as opposed to just a graphics program.

You can even run it in your browser without installing it, using the [Asymptote Web Application](https://tinyurl.com/asyweb). Just enter the code: **import workcone;** (including the semicolon) and click the `Run` button.

### Features of Asymptote:
* provides a portable standard for typesetting mathematical figures, just as TeX/LaTeX has become the standard for typesetting equations;
* generates high-quality PostScript, PDF, SVG, WebGL, and PRC vector graphics;
* embeds 3D vector WebGL graphics within HTML files;
* embeds 3D vector PRC graphics within PDF files;
* inspired by MetaPost, with a much cleaner, powerful C++-like programming syntax and IEEE floating-point numerics;
* runs on all major platforms (UNIX, MacOS, Microsoft Windows);
* mathematically oriented (e.g. rotation of vectors by complex multiplication);
* LaTeX typesetting of labels (for document consistency);
* uses the simplex method and deferred drawing to solve overall size constraint issues between fixed-sized objects (labels and arrowheads) and objects that should scale with figure size;
* fully generalizes MetaPost path construction algorithms to three dimensions;
* compiles commands into virtual machine code for speed without sacrificing portability;
* high-level graphics commands are implemented in the Asymptote language itself, allowing them to be tailored to specific applications. 

### Recommended additional packages
* [MiKTeX](https://chocolatey.org/packages/miktex.install) or another TEX implementation (i.e. [TeX Live](https://chocolatey.org/packages/texlive)) will be required to typeset labels.
* [Ghostscript](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ghostscript.app)
* [ImageMagick](https://chocolatey.org/packages/imagemagick.app) is required to support output formats other than HTML, PDF, SVG, and PNG.
* [Python3](https://chocolatey.org/packages/python3) or [Anaconda3](https://chocolatey.org/packages/anaconda3) is only needed if you wish to try out the graphical user interface ([see Chapter 11](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/doc/GUI.html#GUI) of the documentation.)
