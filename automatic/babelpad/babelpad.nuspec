    <summary>Unicode text editor</summary>
    <description>BabelPad is a free Unicode text editor for Windows that supports the proper rendering of most complex scripts, and allows you to assign different fonts to different scripts in order to facilitate multi-script text editing. It also provides many useful [features and special utilities](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelPad_Features.html) for processing Unicode text. BabelPad supports the most recent version of the Unicode Standard, currently [Unicode 13.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/) (released March 2020).

## Key Features

* Open files in a wide variety of [Unicode or legacy encodings](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelPad_Encodings.html); save files in any Unicode encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32) or Unicode-compatible encoding (GB18030), or as ASCII text with escaped Unicode characters.
* Standard edit functionality, including drag-and-drop editing, multiple undo/redo, find and replace, and casing functions (for all casing scripts in Unicode).
* Left-To-Right (LTR) or Right-To-Left (RTL) page layout; and support for bidirectional text.
* Render text with either a single font or a user-defined composite font (where you can define which font to use for each Unicode block).
* Render complex Unicode scripts using Microsoft's Uniscribe rendering engine or Universal Shaping Engine (for Windows 10).
* Option to render all Unicode characters as individual spacing glyphs (i.e. with no shaping or joining of complex text).
* Option to display text in different colours for different Unicode-defined scripts.
* Convert Unicode text to/from a variety of escape codes (including converting to/from Unicode character names).
* Convert between Unicode characters and code points by pressing Alt-X after a character or at the end of a code point.
* Apply Unicode normalization (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD) to text.
* Convert Chinese text between traditional and simplified character forms.
* Convert Chinese text to Mandarin pinyin readings.
* Convert Japanese text between old and new character forms.
* Convert between Vietnamese alphabet and VIQR.
* Convert Extended Wylie Tibetan transliteration into Unicode Tibetan characters.
* Convert between Yi (Nuosu) romanization and Unicode syllables.
* Sort text according to the Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) or the CLDR Collation Algorithm.
* Manipulate delimited columns of text (reorder, cut, copy, paste and sort columns delimited by tabs or any user-specified character or string).
* Transcode from one list of characters or code points to another list of characters or code points
* Batch replace one list of text strings with another list of text strings
* Advanced character search utility which allows you to find all Unicode characters that match specified criteria.
* Character Map utility to find and enter any Unicode character.
* Supports user-defined custom keyboard layouts and text input methods ([file format](http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelPad_Custom_Input_Method.html)).
* Character lookup tools for finding Han (CJKV) characters by radical/stroke or by Mandarin or Cantonese readings.
* Character lookup tool for finding Yi (Nuosu) characters by radical/stroke.
* Character lookup tool for finding Tangut characters by reference code.
* Various tools providing detailed information about Unicode versions, scripts, planes, blocks.
* Emoji data tool that lists data about all Unicode-defined emoji, and select single or composite emoji.
* Show additional non-Unicode data for Han (CJKV), Tangut and Egyptian Hieroglyph characters.
* Unicode code point and character name of character at the current cursor position is displayed on the status bar, with additional information for Han (CJKV) and Tangut characters.
