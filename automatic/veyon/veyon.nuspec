    <summary>Open Source classroom management software</summary>
    <description>Veyon is a free and Open Source software for computer monitoring and classroom management supporting Windows and Linux. It enables teachers to view and control computer labs and interact with students. Veyon is available in different languages and provides lots of useful features:

### Features
* Intuitive user interface
* Monitor what's going on in computer labs in overview mode and take screenshots
* remote control computers to support and help users
* broadcast teacher's screen to students in real-time by using demo mode (either in fullscreen or in a window)
* lock workstations to direct attention to the instructor
* send text messages to students
* powering on/off and rebooting computers remotely
* remote logoff and remote execution of arbitrary commands/scripts
* Integrate with your domain using built-in LDAP/AD support
* home schooling - Veyon's network technology is not restricted to a subnet and therefore students at home can join lessons via VPN connections just by installing the Veyon service

### Parameters
This package will install the client components with default settings unless these parameters are provided:

* `/Master` - Also install the "master" application for monitoring client computers
* `/Config:(absolute path-to-json)` - Apply a [configuration file](https://docs.veyon.io/en/4.1/admin/configuration.html#importing-exporting-a-configuration). 
  
###### Example : 
  `choco install veyon --params '"/config:C:\setup\LabConfig.json"'`
_(note: add double-double quotes around the path if it contains spaces)_
