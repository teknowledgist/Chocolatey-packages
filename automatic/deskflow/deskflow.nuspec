    <summary>Deskflow lets you share one mouse and keyboard between multiple computers on Windows, macOS and Linux. It's like a software KVM (but without video). </summary>
    <description>Deskflow is a free and open source keyboard and mouse sharing app. Use the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad of one computer to control nearby computers, and work seamlessly between them. It's like a software KVM (but without the video). TLS encryption is enabled by default. Wayland is supported. **Clipboard sharing is supported.**

### Is Deskflow compatible with Synergy, Input Leap, or Barrier?

Yes, Deskflow has network compatibility with all forks:
- Requires Deskflow &gt;= v1.17.0.96
- Deskflow will *just work* with Input Leap and Barrier (server or client).
- Connecting a Deskflow client to a Synergy server will also *just work*.
- To connect a Synergy client, you need to select the Synergy protocol in the Deskflow server settings.

However, **Deskflow cannot be installed on the same computer as Barrier, Input Leap, or Synergy!**
