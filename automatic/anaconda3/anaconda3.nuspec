    <summary>The most trusted Python distribution for data science</summary>
    <description>Anaconda® is a package manager, an environment manager, a Python distribution, and a collection of [over 1,000+ open source packages](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs/). It is free and easy to install, and it offers free community support.

Anaconda Distribution contains conda and Anaconda Navigator.  You can try both conda and Navigator to see which is right for you to manage your packages and environments. You can even switch between them, and the work you do with one can be viewed in the other.

Download the [Anaconda Cheat Sheet](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/cheatsheet/#) (694 KB PDF) for a quick guide to using Anaconda, or take a look at [DataCamp.com's "Cheat Sheet For Beginners"](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-data-science-cheat-sheet-basics).

##### Package Defaults
Anaconda Python:

* will install for **all users**
* **will** be registered as the default Python
* will install to `$ChocolateyToolsLocation\Anaconda3` (i.e. `C:\Tools\Anaconda3` by default)
* **will not** be added to the path

You can change any of the defaults with package parameters:

* `/JustMe` - Install for only the current user.
* `/DoNotRegister` - Do not register Anaconda Python as the default Python.
* `/D:(path)` - Choose another, *existing*, parent directory to place the 'Anaconda3' directory.
* `/AddToPath` - Add Anaconda Python to the path. *Note: As of Anaconda Distribution 2022.05, the option to add Anaconda to the PATH environment variable during an All Users installation (the default for this package) has been disabled. This was done to address a [security exploit](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26526). You can still add Anaconda to the PATH environment variable during a JustMe installation.*

###### Example : 
  `choco install anaconda3 --params '"/AddToPath /D:c:\MyTools"'`

### 64-bit only
The 2022.05 release is the last of Anaconda Distribution that will support Windows 32-bit (win-32).
