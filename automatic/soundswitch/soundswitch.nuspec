    <summary>Switch your default playback devices and/or recording devices using simple hotkeys.</summary>
    <description>**SoundSwitch** offers you the opportunity to switch your playback and recording devices using simple **hotkeys**.

**No more** navigating througth several menus and screens. Just configure SoundSwitch **once** and you are able to switch between your devices as fast as never before!

#### Easy
To start using it, simply use the default hotkey: CTRL + ALT + F11.
You can also Double Click on the Systray Icon.

#### Speeds up
No more navigating through several menus and screens. Just configure SoundSwitch once - and you are able to switch between your devices as fast as never before!

#### Customisable
Right click the SoundSwitch icon in your system tray and choose Settings. Now select the devices between which you want to toggle. Optionally you can also change the keyboard combination. If you want the application to start automatically when your PC boots up, check the box Start automatically with Windows.

#### Mutlilingual
Comes in English, French, German, Korean, Norwegian Bokmål, Polish and Russian. More translation to come. If you want SoundSwitch in your language, don't hesitate to contribute to the Weblate Project.

## Features
* Recording Devices - SoundSwitch can also take care of your recording devices. You can set specifics hotkeys as for the playback devices.
* Notifications - SoundSwitch provides five types of notification when a device was changed.
    * Banner - Uses a custom always-on-top frame, useful for in-game usage. This is the recommended default display style.
    * Windows Notification - Uses the balloon tip of Windows. In the case of Windows 7, it's the little balloon that opens next to the systray icon. For Windows 10, it's the notification system that slides from the right corner of the screen.
    * Sound Notification - This notification is a sound played on the switched device. This way when you are switching devices, the new device will 'chime' to tell you it's selected.
    * Customized Sound Notification - The same as a Sound Notification but you can specify the sound which is played.
    
    If you want to return to a silent Toast Notification, open the file selector, and just do Cancel. Doing that will remove the set sound.
