#### Trial-ware
This package is for the open source QCAD, *bundled with a free trial of QCAD Professional*. The trial runs 15min at a time and can then be restarted. You can order QCAD Professional from the [Online Shop](https://www.qcad.org/online-shop). Alternatively, you can choose to remove the trial and use the reduced free QCAD Community Edition instead.

Use the `-params` switch argument of `/CommunityEdition` to remove the commercial plugins and leave a fully GPLv3-compliant install.
