    <summary>A tool for authoring paginated, Power Bi reports</summary>
    <description>Power BI Report Builder is a tool for authoring paginated reports that you can publish to the Power BI service. When you design a paginated report, you're creating a report definition that specifies what data to retrieve, where to get it, and how to display it. When you run the report, the report processor takes the report definition you have specified, retrieves the data, and combines it with the report layout to generate the report. You preview your report in Report Builder. Then publish your report to the Power BI service.
