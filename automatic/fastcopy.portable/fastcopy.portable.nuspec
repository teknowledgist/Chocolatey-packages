    <summary>The Fastest Copy/Delete Software on Windows.</summary>
    <description>FastCopy is **the Fastest Copy/Delete Software on Windows**.

It supports UNICODE and over MAX_PATH (260 characters) file pathnames.

It automatically selects different methods depending on whether the source and destination directories are on the same or different drive.
* **Different drive:** Reading and writing are processed respectively in parallel by separate threads.
* **Same drive:**	Reading is processed until the buffer fills. When the buffer is filled, writing is started and processed in bulk.

Reading/Writing is processed with no OS cache so other applications do not become slow.

It can achieve reading/writing performance that is close to the device limit.

Include/Exclude filter (UNIX Wildcard style) can be specified. In ver3.0 or later, relative paths can be specified.

It runs fast and does not hog resources, because MFC is not used. (Designed using Win32 API and C Runtime only)

You can modify this software, because all source code has been opened to the public under the GPL ver3 license.
