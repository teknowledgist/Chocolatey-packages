    <description> SCP is a concordance and word listing program that is able to read texts written in many languages and create word lists and search natural language text files for words, phrases, and patterns. There are built-in alphabets for English, French, German, Polish, Greek, Russian, etc. SCP contains an alphabet editor which you can use to create alphabets for any other language. 

### Features

* You can save concordances in html to display on the web.
* You can create word lists, which you can sort , print, or save. Sorting can be done in ascending or descending alphabetic or frequency order.
